## Usage

The application randomly generates startig and finish points at each start.
The user can freely draw the walls of the maze for the algorithm to traverse.
After drawing, the user can select the desired algorithm by pressing one of the following buttons:
- 'D' for Depth First Search
- 'B' for Breadth First Search
- 'U' for Uniform Cost Search (in practice just like BFS due to the equal weights between nodes)
- 'J' for Dijkstra's Algorithm (very similar to the UCS, but computing the distances to all nodes)
- 'A' for A*

Close and reopen the app for a new simulation.
